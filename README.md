Make OSX Better 
===============  
(for technical folks who use a lot of commandline tools)

Tools that should be installed to make life on OSX more productive and even more intuitive if you are coming from Windows or Linux. 

##Terminal  
OSX Terminal sucks (feature wise), I'm used to [terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) for Linux - You can easily do split screen (right click 'Split pane Vertically' or 'Horizontally') with iTerm2, an send commands to all panes at the same time (right click 'Toggle broadcast input'):

##Linux/Unix commandline tools
Tons of familiar GNU tools missing from OSX, install homebrew then install packages like 'coreutils', wget, vim (GNU vim).

[The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) - Like ack, and much much faster.

##Text Editor
Syntax highlighting, tabs, the works.  And comes with a number of color schemes that can make staring at code much easier on the eyes.

I'm gonna throw in a plug for [Atom](http://atom.io) from Github.

##Screen keep awake  
QUICK!  Change your power settings to never turn on screensaver before starting your presentation.  OR you could click on the little coffee cup in your taskbar.  Caffeine keeps your computer from going to sleep while you are simply watching a video or training or doing a presentation.

##Window Snapping
Window snapping should be in every GUI by default, but OSX requires a tool.  Don't configure anything, just install it and have it startup by default:

Spectacle is another great one: http://spectacleapp.com/

What to I mean by "Window snapping"?  It's not screenshots, see here:

##Click on date/time and see the calendar
Novel idea right?  Apple doesn't seem to think so (Even on Yosemite).

Day-O isn't maintained anymore, Itsycal is also more feature rich: http://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/

##For the Windows converts
Miss right clicking to copy/paste?  Miss sorting files and having directories on top?  This tool replaces the default Finder.

## Interacting with HTTP APIs

Curl is pretty arcane for advanced use (posting forms, etc). HTTPie is simpler, and pretty prints its output. It's written in python.

OS X has a package manager: http://brew.sh/
